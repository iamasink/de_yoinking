Probably the best Counter Strike: Global Offensive map ever to exist.

This map was made using [Hammer++](https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/) and [TAR CS:GO Auto Radar](https://github.com/18swenskiq/CS-GO-Auto-Radar).   
You will need these if you wish to edit it else the map may have issues.

The .BSP (playable map) is available on the Steam workshop:
